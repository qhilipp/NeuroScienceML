## Abstract ðŸ¤ 
This sandbox for training SVN algorithms to classify a set of 2 dimensional data points is a part of my introduction to machine learning in our "Computational Neuroscience Student Initiative". It offers a canvas that visualizes the data as well as the guessed decisions of your trained SVN algorithm.

## How to use ðŸ¤”
It's your task to implement the kernel function, the hyperplane function and the cross validation algorithm.

## Installation ðŸ’»
All you need is Java setup on your machine and an IDE. There are no additional libraries, that need to be installed.
