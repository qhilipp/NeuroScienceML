## Abstract 🤠
This sandbox for training SVN algorithms to classify a set of 2 dimensional data points is a part of my introduction to machine learning in our "Computational Neuroscience Student Initiative". It offers a canvas that visualizes the data as well as the guessed decisions of your trained SVN algorithm.

## The scenario
You are a medical researcher and you and your team developed a new vaccine against a dangerous virus. Hower this vaccine sadly does not work on every patient. You gathered the age and doses for each test patient you vaccinated and note the vaccination result after a few weeks.  So you know for about 1000 patients their age, the doses which they were vaccinated with and whether or not the vaccination was successful.

## How to use 🤔
It's your task to implement the kernel function, the function to find the hyperparameters and the cross validation algorithm.

## Installation 💻
All you need is Java setup on your machine and an IDE. There are no additional libraries, that need to be installed.
